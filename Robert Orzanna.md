## Github or NearlyFreeSpeech.net?

How to decide which of the two is the more sustainable hosting alternative? Github that is used by many open-source projects and thus one can infer that Github helps the open-source movement? Or NearlyFreeSpeech.net that is owned collectively and actively promotes the freedom of speech? These are examples of difficult cases for me to decide which of the presented alternatives is better for sustainable consumption.

Typora.io is non-free software. However, I use it because it can export a table of contents and provides a visual table editor. Using non-free software worries me.

Using Google's services is not compatible with Sustainable Development. However, it is an incumbent I cannot withdraw from. I use its Drive service to backup my entire digital life. It is convenient and I am afraid to lose access to my digital life.
