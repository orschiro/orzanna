## Sustainable consumption and care

2016-12-12-20:27:21

I can speak a lot about sustainable consumption and preach to other people how much more personal satisfaction I gain from supporting alternatives. However, this falls short if I am not able to take care of things myself. I tend to carelessly use my "stuff". Things tend to break very quickly with me and do not last for a long time. Something I need to work on myself. I cannot solely blame the producer to please produce more durable objects that are impossible to break.

## Creating an automatic timestamp entry using CopyQ

2016-12-12-09:02:30

CopyQ is an excellent open-source tool to automatically generate a timestamp like the above one. The implementation is shown in [this screenshot](copyq-timestamp.png). I assign this functionality to a keyboard shortcut to automatically paste the timestamp into my documents. 

`copyq:`

`var time = dateString('yyyy-MM-dd-hh:mm:ss')`

`copy(time)`

`paste()`

## Github or NearlyFreeSpeech.net?

How to decide which of the two is the more sustainable hosting alternative? Github that is used by many open-source projects and thus one can infer that Github helps the open-source movement? Or NearlyFreeSpeech.net that is owned collectively and actively promotes the freedom of speech? These are examples of difficult cases for me to decide which of the presented alternatives is better for sustainable consumption. 

## Sustainable email list options

It does not have to be Google Groups. There are alternatives. Here are two ideas:

- [Posteo](https://posteo.de/en/help/does-posteo-offer-mailing-lists) 
- [lists.riseup.net](https://lists.riseup.net/www/)

## Using non-free Typora.io software

2016-12-09-14:14:44

Typora.io is non-free software. However, I use it because it can export a table of contents and provides a visual table editor. Using non-free software worries me.

## Relying on Google Drive

2016-12-09-14:08:03

Using Google's services is not compatible with Sustainable Development. However, it is an incumbent I cannot withdraw from. I use its Drive service to backup my entire digital life. It is convenient and I am afraid to lose access to my digital life.
