Robert Orzanna
==============

I focus on degrowth[^degrowth], sustainable consumption[^scorai], good life, happiness and
humane technology. For any of these, I am happy to talk and collaborate
with you. :-) Just write me an email[^email]. If deemed necessary, you may
read my CV[^CV].

I am a big fan of podcast communication and happily share my curated
list of podcasts (subscribe on player.fm[^player.fm] or via RSS[^RSS]). Or maybe you want
to listen to the Degrowth Audiobook[^DegrowthAudiobook] that I am coordinating.

If you are a research scholar, you might be looking for my latest
co-authored publication "Culture meets Flows: The Cultural Dimension of
Urban Metabolism"[^CulturemeetsFlows] that had been cited by the German Advisory Council on
Global Change in the report "Humanity on the move: Unlocking the transformative power of cities"[^Humanityonthemove].

Lastly, I want to share my life learning lessons. The ones I find
important enough to put here and remind myself over and over again:

-   Do not delete old creations. Base new creations on the old.
-   …more to follow soon…
