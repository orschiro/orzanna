*“Life is.
It does not require any further concretization because any descriptive attempt would narrow down the incomprehensiveness of what life can all be.
How does one live life that is?”*

Hello and welcome. If you want to reach out to me, please best write me an email[^email]. If you want to know more about me, you can take a look at my CV[^CV].

Currently, I:

- am part of Sheetgo[^1],
- approve subtitles for the Amara foundation[^3],
- support the FZI[^4] as a research assistant,
- and maintain the websites of Research & Degrowth[^degrowth] and SCORAI[^scorai].

This is a list of things I like to do:

- Begin the day with a morning routine of excercising and stretching, nose salt washing, checking my daily bookmarks folder, drinking coffee and playing guitar.
- Draw my to-dos as a paper mind-map[^mindmap].
- Drink apple cider vinegar.
- Eat bee pollen.
- Commute on inline skates.
- Work at a standing desk.
- Take micro breaks[^safeeyes].
- Wake up and go to bed early.
- Listen to[^podcast] and record podcasts[^myPodcasts].

I have an academic background in sustainable development and spend a lot of time thinking about consumption — this explains the huge table below. As a research scholar you might be interested in my co-authored publication “*Culture meets Flows: The Cultural Dimension of
Urban Metabolism*”[^CulturemeetsFlows] that had been cited by the German Advisory Council on
Global Change (WBGU) in their report “*Humanity on the move: Unlocking the transformative power of cities*”[^Humanityonthemove].

Final note, this simple website is made with ♥ and made possible thanks to Atom Editor[^atom], Github Pages[^githubpages] and Ubuntu MATE[^MATE]. The source code of this page is publicly available[^source].

Now, as promised my attempt to operationalise my own sustainable consumption (work in progress).
