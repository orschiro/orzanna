# Robert Orzanna

*I haven't found the formula to a good life (yet). But modest 27 years of life experience gave me the current function to work with:*

```
until Stress = 0:
  declutter {
    start with:
      thing.FeelingOverTime != "good"
  }
```

Hello and welcome. If you want to reach out to me, please best write me an email[^email]. If you want to know more about me, you can take a look at my CV[^CV].

Currently, I:

- am part of Sheetgo[^1],
- approve subtitles for the Amara foundation[^3],
- support the FZI[^4] as a research assistant,
- and maintain the websites of Research & Degrowth[^degrowth] and SCORAI[^scorai].

This is a list of things I like to do regularly:

- Start the day with a good morning routine that begins with waking up at 05:25 AM, nose salt washing, drinking water with a shot of apple cider vinegar, enjoying a good coffee while going through my daily list of web bookmarks, emails and side tasks,  exercising and stretching, playing the guitar, and finally having a good breakfast.
- Listen to[^podcast], coordinate[^degrowthpodcast], and record podcasts[^myPodcasts].
- Write my to-do in paper-based Markdown[^markdownpaper].
- Be on my inline skates.
- Go for a run every second day or so.
- Work at a standing desk.
- Take regular breaks from work[^safeeyes].
- Try not to use my laptop in the evening hours.
- Regularly read a newspaper printed on real paper to financially aid investigative journalism.
- Going to bed around 10:00 PM to maintain a decent sleep cycle.
- Make the weekends different from my weekly routine.

I have an academic background in sustainable development and spend a lot of time thinking about consumption — this explains the huge table below which is still work-in-progress. As a research scholar you might be interested in my co-authored publication “*Culture meets Flows: The Cultural Dimension of Urban Metabolism*”[^CulturemeetsFlows] that had been cited by the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) in their report “*Humanity on the move: Unlocking the transformative power of cities*”[^Humanityonthemove].

Final note, this simple website is updated regularly with ♥ and made possible thanks to Typora[^typora], Github Pages[^githubpages] and Ubuntu MATE[^MATE]. The source code of this page is publicly available[^source].
