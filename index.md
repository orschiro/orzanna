*“Life is.
It does not require any further concretization because any descriptive attempt would narrow down the incomprehensiveness of what life can all be.
How does one live a life that is?”*[^5]

Hello and welcome. If you want to reach out to me, please best write me an email[^email]. If you want to know more about me, you can take a look at my CV[^CV].

Currently, my main occupation is to support the sustainable development of Sheetgo[^1]. Besides, I endorse to be lazy. There is nothing wrong about it — and it is sustainable, too.

Here is my current list of *“I Love To”*:

- Drink apple cider vinegar.
- Wake up at 05:25 AM.
- Be boring and go to bed at 10 PM.
- Check my daily bookmark folder[^bookmark].
- Listen to[^podcast] and record podcasts[^myPodcasts].
- Improve Ubuntu MATE[^MATE].
- Approve subtitles for the Amara foundation[^3].
- Help the FZI[^4] as a research assistant.
- Maintain the websites of Research & Degrowth[^degrowth] and SCORAI[^scorai].

Finally, if you are a research scholar, you might be interested in my co-authored publication “*Culture meets Flows: The Cultural Dimension of
Urban Metabolism*”[^CulturemeetsFlows] that had been cited by the German Advisory Council on
Global Change (WBGU) in their report “*Humanity on the move: Unlocking the transformative power of cities*”[^Humanityonthemove].
