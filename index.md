# Robert Orzanna

*I haven't found the formula to a good life (yet). But modest 27 years of life experience gave me the current function to work with:*

```
until Stress = 0:
  declutter {
    start with:
      thing.FeelingOverTime != "good"
  }
```

Hello and welcome. If you want to reach out to me, please best write me an email[^email]. If you want to know more about me, you can take a look at my CV[^CV].

Currently, I:

- am part of Sheetgo[^1],
- approve subtitles for the Amara foundation[^3],
- support the FZI[^4] as a research assistant,
- and maintain the websites of Research & Degrowth[^degrowth] and SCORAI[^scorai].

This is a list of things I like to do:

- Begin the day with a morning routine of exercising and stretching, nose salt washing, drinking apple cider vinegar, going through my daily list of web bookmarks while enjoying a good coffee and playing the guitar.
- Listen to[^podcast] and record podcasts[^myPodcasts].
- Draw my to-dos as a paper mind-map[^mindmap].
- Be on my inline skates.
- Work at a standing desk.
- Take regular breaks[^safeeyes].
- Wake up and go to bed early.

I have an academic background in sustainable development and spend a lot of time thinking about consumption — this explains the huge table below which is still work-in-progress. As a research scholar you might be interested in my co-authored publication “*Culture meets Flows: The Cultural Dimension of Urban Metabolism*”[^CulturemeetsFlows] that had been cited by the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) in their report “*Humanity on the move: Unlocking the transformative power of cities*”[^Humanityonthemove].

Final note, this simple website is updated regularly with ♥ and made possible thanks to Typora[^typora], Github Pages[^githubpages] and Ubuntu MATE[^MATE]. The source code of this page is publicly available[^source].
